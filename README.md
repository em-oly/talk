Simple text - no GIF or emojis or hashtags or links // User inputs standard text.

Limit characters as well as number of responses - stop spam.

Stretch Requirements:
Subthreading - spawn new discussions based on daily prompts.
Top positive / negative comment list.
Users can block other users / not see their comments.
